# Endpoints

All the endpoints described in this document are meant to be implemented by a Third party backend and exposed by it to a Third party app via an authenticated endpoint. The Third party app will never directly communicate with the 2hire as Adapter (2aa) backend.

### Constants

**`Base url: https://adapter.2hire.io/api/v1`**

**`Authorization header: "Authorization":"Bearer {JWT_TOKEN}"`**

### Starting a offline session

This endpoint is used to gather the needed encrypted data to start a bluetooth communication session with the box, it's the first step that has to be performed in order to communicate with the vehicle.

### Ending a offline session

This endpoint is used to end a offline session by providing the history of the commands executed on the offline box, the history will be validated to prevent bad actors sending only part of the session to trick the third party backend in thinking the vehicle is currently in a status it is not. This is especially useful in the scenario when an application has been compromised.
